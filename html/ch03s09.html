			While the answers provided in Phake should be able to cover most of the scenarios you will run into when using mocks in your unit tests there may occasionally be times when you need more control over what is returned from your mock methods. When this is the case, you can use a custom answer. All answers in Phake implement the Phake_Stubber_IAnswer interface. This interface defines a single method called getAnswer() that can be used to return what will be returned from a call to the method being stubbed. If you need to get access to how the method you are stubbing was invoked, there is a more complex set of interfaces that can be implemented: Phake_Stubber_Answers_IDelegator and Phake_Stubber_IAnswerDelegate.

		<p>
			Phake_Stubber_Answers_IDelegator extends Phake_Stubber_IAnswer and defines an additional method called processAnswer() that is used to perform processing on the results of getAnswer() prior to passing it on to the stub’s caller. Phake_Stubber_IAnswerDelegate defines an interface that allows you to create a callback that is called to generate the answer from the stub. It defines getCallBack() which allows you to generate a PHP callback based on the object, method, and arguments that a stub was called with. It also defines getArguments() which allows you to generate the arguments that will be passed to the callback based on the method name and arguments the stub was called with.
